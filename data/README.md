## tmQMg graph files

The files of the actual graphs are stored on the NIRD data archive and can be found [here](https://data.archive.sigma2.no/dataset/tmqmg).

In particular the three different types of graphs are:

###### [baseline graphs](https://data.archive.sigma2.no/dataset/4f94f626-b18c-458c-946f-d7052bb05982/download/baseline_graphs.zip)
- Reference graphs with NBO topology and basic, periodic-table features.
###### [u-NatQ graphs](https://data.archive.sigma2.no/dataset/4f94f626-b18c-458c-946f-d7052bb05982/download/u-NatQ_graphs.zip)
- Undirected graphs with NBO topology and rich features from QM calculations.
###### [d-NatQ graphs](https://data.archive.sigma2.no/dataset/4f94f626-b18c-458c-946f-d7052bb05982/download/d-NatQ_graphs.zip)
- Directed graphs with SOPA topology and rich features from QM calculations.
